During my internship at Wunderman Thompson, I had great mentors who guided me, helping me learn about modern web development.

I worked on various projects, both internal and commercial, for clients in the United Kingdom.

At first, the workload seemed overwhelming, but I quickly adapted and learned more about web development processes each day.

My dedication to learning and improving led to me securing a Junior position in the company after my internship ended.
