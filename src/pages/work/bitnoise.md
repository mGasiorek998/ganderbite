During my tenure, I collaborated on projects for clients in Europe and the USA. These ranged from making eye-catching landing pages to building complex web and mobile apps.

In each of the products, I was involved in every step of the process, from picking tools and estimating the work to showing the products to clients.

Some product requirements needed me to handle both the frontend and backend. This tested my backend skills, from basic tasks like data management to more advanced features like video and camera streaming.

I worked in medium to large teams of software developers, where we prioritized teamwork to efficiently deliver products. This collaborative approach ensured both that each project met its goals effectively and learn from each other.

Outside of project work, I've contributed to various articles, sharing my knowledge with fellow developers beyond the company.
